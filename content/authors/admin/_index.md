Hello! I am a fourth year graduate student studying Statistics Education in the Department of Educational Psychology at the Univeristy of Minnesota. After completing a bachelors degree in Mathematics at St. Lawrence University, I continued my academic journey to get a Masters in Statistics from Iowa State University. During my time at ISU I developed a passion for teaching and decided to pursue a Ph.d. in Statistics Education.
